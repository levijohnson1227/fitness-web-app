# Overview

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}
This is a fitness tracker web app. The web app allows a user to enter in exercise information and save it too a firestore database. You can start the test server from VS code by running the command
"npm run dev" this gives a local host address to enteract with the web app. I developed this web app with the hopes of learning some of the basics of React.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

I created a single webpage using React. The user has the ability to submit different execise information and save it to the database. After the information is saved to the database, it is
displayed to the user.

# Development Environment

For this project I used React along with Vite. The back end functions are writen in JavaScript. The database linked is a firestore database.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- A lot of my focus in developing this app was getting it to interact with the database. In the future I would like focus presenting the information better to the user.
- I would also like to add more funtionality to the app. Giving the user the ability to select an exercise and edit the information from the app.
- The addition of authenticaiton could really make the app better too. Allowing users to sign in and only see their information.
